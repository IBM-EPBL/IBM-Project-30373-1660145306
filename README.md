A Novel Method for Handwritten Digit Recognition System
The problem is recognizing the human handwritten digits by system. 
It is hard for the machines to identify the digits because handwritten digits are not perfect and can be of many different shapes and sizes which cause difficulty in recognizing them.
The goal is to upload the image of the handwritten digit and identify the digit with accuracy.
